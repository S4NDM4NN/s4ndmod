// Martin - 6/9/10
// This will run the evenbalance official pb setup with a quiet command line prompt.
the /ap string will need to be generated by the installer (due to vista vs xp Program Files)

We need to test to see what happens when we add a game that doesnt have any PB files.

pbsetup /q --i-accept-the-pb-eula /ag "rtcw" /ap "C:\Program Files (x86)\Return To Castle Wolfenstein 13 PB" /u

pbsetup /q --i-accept-the-pb-eula /u
